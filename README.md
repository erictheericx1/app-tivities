# Apptivities
Sometime,  you are so drained after work or school that you cannot think straight, if at all.  You spend so much time trying to decompress and restart your mind that you end up just doing nothing.  

Our goal is to make having fun and finding things to do easy! Just enter your interests and location and let Apptivities do the work. This app will help you do just that!
